I am a Research Scientist at [ASAPP](https://www.asapp.com/). I completed [my PhD](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~vcirik/) at the [Language Technologies Institute](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu) of [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu). My Ph.D. was on grounded language understanding -- the intersection of natural language processing, computer vision, and machine learning.
