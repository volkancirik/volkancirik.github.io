I recently completed my PhD candidate at the [Language Technologies Institute](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu) of [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu). I was very fortunate to be advised by [Louis-Philippe Morency](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~morency/) and [Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tberg/). My Ph.D. was on grounded language understanding -- the intersection of natural language processing, computer vision, and machine learning.
